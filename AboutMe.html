            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Levnicolayevich Cruz Adlawan, 24 years old, Married to my lovely Wife Jennie D. Adlawan. I am a student of Camarines Norte State College and taking the course Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, currently in 2nd year block C. <br><br>
            So why did I chose Information Technology? <br> <br>
            I am very interested in technology and computers since I was a little boy, that's what inspired me to take this course, also to have a nice job for my family, and I’m excited to use what I learn in my future jobs and in my everyday life. <br><br>
            As I continue my education, I hope to combine my skills with my values to make a positive difference in both the technological world and in our real life.
